# Hire Thy Gator Technical Interview Exercises

## Instructions for Interviewer 

In this exercise, you will be pairing up with a `[self-selected/random]` student and each of you will interview the other on a technical interview question. Technical interviews act as gatekeepers to joining computing jobs and the goal of this assignment is to experience a technical interview in a low-stakes environment. If you are not familiar with a technical interview, here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw 


### As an Interviewer, 
- You are free to research and **select any question** from these topics to ask the interviewee (other student): `[Topics, e.g. Binary Search Trees and Heaps]`. 
- The interviewee (other student) must not know what problem you are going to ask them beforehand.
- You must ask them a single technical interview problem and provide them hints if the candidate is stuck for too long.
- The questions/problem should be of level `[Easy or Medium]` if selecting from external resources that categorize questions by difficulty.
- You need to **prepare beforehand** on what question you are going to ask them and be familiar with at least one solution.

### Logistics
- You **must setup/coordinate time** with another student for a 45-60 minutes Zoom interview and it is your responsibility to record the meeting.
- The interview must take place on a **Google Doc** without access to an IDE or compiler. 
- The **default programming language** for the interview is **C++**. However, if both the interviewer and interviewee are familiar with a certain programming language and the interviewee wants to use that language to code their solution, it is fine to use another language such as Python or Java.
- The first 40-45 minutes must be used for the technical interview challenge followed by a 15-20 minutes session on giving **actionable feedback** to the interviewee:
    - What went well?
    - What parts can the candidate improve on regarding the technical solution and delivering a solution in a future interview (non-technical aspects: example - talking out loud, asking more questions, thinking before jumping to solving the problem, etc.)?

### Deliverables
- The interviewer is responsible for 
    - submitting a link to the video recording for the interview with the interviewee 
    - the link to the Google doc containing the interviewee's solution 
    - a small survey/reflection exercise in this Quiz 
- Note: You cannot upload a video on Canvas. You can upload the video on YouTube using "Unlisted" setting, on Google Drive, or Dropbox.
- Make sure to have the correct visibility setting for the video and Google doc file for the purpose of grading by opening the URL in Incognito mode on Chrome or in a Private Tab on Safari/Firefox.
