# Hire Thy Gator Technical Interview Exercises

## Instructions for Interviewee [When you were getting interviewed] 

In this exercise, you will be pairing up with a `[self-selected/random]` student and each of you will interview the other on a technical interview question. Technical interviews act as gatekeepers to joining computing jobs and the goal of this assignment is to experience a technical interview in a low-stakes environment. If you are not familiar with a technical interview, here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw


### As an Interviewee, 
- You will be given one technical question from either one of the topics: `[Topics, e.g. Binary Search Trees and Heaps]`.  
- First walk through how you will approach the problem, rather than jumping into coding the solution.
- Ask a lot of questions to the interviewer if you want to clarifying constraints of the problem or ask them if you need an hint.
- Talk aloud your thoughts and try to improve your code through iterations.
- Walkthrough your code with a test case to conclude the interview and fix bugs if any.

### Logistics
- You **must setup/coordinate time** with another student for a 45-60 minutes Zoom interview.
- The interview must take place on a **Google Doc** without access to an IDE or compiler.Â 
- The **default programming language** for the interview is **C++**. However, if both the interviewer and interviewee are familiar with a certain programming language and the interviewee wants to use that language to code their solution, it is fine to use another language such as Python or Java.
- The first 40-45 minutes must be used for the technical interview challenge followed by a 15-20 minutes session on **receiving** feedback from the interviewer. 

### Deliverables
- The interviewee is responsible for 
    - submitting a link to the Google doc of the your solution 
    - a small survey/reflection exercise in this Quiz 
- Make sure to have the correct visibility setting for the Google doc file for the purpose of grading by opening the URL in Incognito mode on Chrome or in a Private Tab on Safari/Firefox.
